# SimpleHash - Hashing without the hassle!

Welcome to the official repository for Simple Hash. The main intention of this application is to allow users to easily convert a string into a SHA-256 hash. I decided to create this program as a way to introduce newcomers to hashing, as there is little code behind the scenes and it is easy to understand what is going on. The code is fully commented, so feel free to take a look!

If you don't fancy looking at the Source Code and just want to use the program, then head over to the <a href="https://github.com/105hua/Simple-Hash/releases">Releases</a> page to download the latest pre-compiled build!

# Program Information

Currently, SimpleHash supports all of the algorithms that the System.Security.Cryptography library supports, those are:

- MD5
- SHA-1
- SHA-256
- SHA-384
- SHA-512

In the future, I may modify SimpleHash to use BouncyCastle, so that I am able to provide more Hashing Algorithms to use.
