# Simple Hash - Hashing without the hassle!

Welcome to the official repository for Simple Hash. The main intention of this application is to allow users to easily convert a string into a SHA-256 hash. I decided to create this program as a way to introduce newcomers to hashing, as there is little code behind the scenes and it is easy to understand what is going on.

Comments will be introduced in a later commit, however, the initial solution is available here. I will also be providing pre-compiled versions of this program at a later date.
